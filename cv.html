                <li><strong>Growing Up Disillusioned?</strong> <em> with Lucas Drouhot, Meta van der Linden and Frank van Tubergen. </em> <br>
                Minority youth
                    exhibit high educational expectations across multiple European countries. 
                    Previous research has focused on how this contributes to reducing inequalities between second-generation children and children of 
                    natives through higher grades and enrollment rates in tertiary education, overlooking that high educational expectations might have
                    negative consequences when unfulfilled. We address this gap by investigating how unmet educational expectations influence perceptions
                    of discrimination among youth exiting school in Spain. We utilize a three-wave panel of second-generation children living in Spain, 
                    interviewed between the ages of 14 and 22. Using detailed information on their educational expectations and achieved educational levels,
                    we assess whether unmet expectations correlate with increased perceptions of discrimination. We examine the heterogeneity in the impact 
                    of unmet expectations, hypothesizing that children with highly educated parents are more likely to perceive discrimination. Our findings
                    indicate that children who exit the educational system earlier exhibit heightened perceptions of discrimination when their exit does not
                    meet their expectations. Although we find that parental education is positively associated with discrimination perceptions among children, 
                    we find no evidence for interaction effects with unmet expectations. Children of highly educated parents thus appear more attuned to 
                    discrimination in general, but not more likely to frame their experiences of failure as discriminatory. </li>
                
                <li><strong>What Am I Discriminated For? Discrimination awareness spillover effects for multiply disadvantaged groups</strong> <em> With Merlin Schaeffer. </em>  <br>
                 We study whether multiply disadvantaged individuals (compared to uniquely disadvantaged ones) interpret information about discrimination of
                    one of their ingroups. Using a survey experiment, we investigate whether threat to one outgroup generalizes to other outgroups. Furthermore, 
                    for uniquely disadvantaged individuals we seek to understand whether information about discrimination of an outgroup fosters stigma-based solidarity
                    or competition.</li>
