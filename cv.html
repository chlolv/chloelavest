                    <strong>Beyond the Integration Paradox</strong> Highly educated minority individuals perceive more 
                    ethnic discrimination than their less educated counterparts – a now well-established finding 
                    referred to as the “integration paradox”. In this paper, we study whether this purported paradox 
                    captures general educational effects on the lived experiences of historically disadvantaged populations 
                    going beyond the scope of integration among immigrants. We do so by comparing educational effects on 
                    perceptions of ethnic discrimination among ethnic minorities with educational effects on perceptions 
                    of gender discrimination among women. We also study the discrimination experiences of the majority population, 
                    as well as intersectional dimensions in the experiences of minority women and those reporting multiple grounds 
                    for discrimination. Analyses based on representative data from two cross-sectional surveys in France - 
                    Trajectoires et Origines 1 and 2 – involving over 35,000 respondents, uncover a notable trend: highly educated 
                    individuals, including both ethnic minorities and women, are more likely to report discrimination, and that those
                     who report discrimination on one ground are also more likely to report it on another ground. Our results 
                     suggest that the so-called integration paradox reflects more general educational effects on subjective 
                     experiences of exclusion that are not unique to immigrant-origin populations.

                    <strong>Growing up Disillusioned?</strong> Children of immigrants display high educational aspirations and expectations.
                     This leads to the reduction of origin-related gaps in achievements, as children growing up in relatively more 
                     deprived families aim higher, aim more often for academic tracks, and stay in education longer than native students
                      from similar socio-economic backgrounds. However, this can also lead to disappointment, when educational aspirations
                       are not fulfilled. We study how unmet educational aspirations and expectations might fuel discrimination perceptions 
                       among children of immigrants in Spain. Following aspirations and achieved education across 8 years, from mandatory 
                       school to labor market entry, we identify when and for whom expectations turn sour. Using individual fixed-effects models,
                        we show that disappointed children who prematurely leave the educational system display increased discrimination reports 
                        compared to their peers.

                    <strong>Who do They Think You Are?</strong> Estimates of intergenerational educational mobility are generally computed 
                    using a combination of self- and proxy-reports of one’s and one’s parents’ education. Such reports are easily collected,
                    offering a cost-effective alternative to collecting multiple self-reports or register data. However, the bias that 
                    proxy-reports could introduce in the measurement of intergenerational educational mobility is rarely assessed. Our study 
                    fills this gap and assesses how reliable people are when they report their parents’ or their child’s educational attainment. 
                    We find that both parents and children tend to underestimate the educational distance between themselves and their family members,
                     thus inflating estimates of educational reproduction. This trend is larger whenchildren act as proxy-reporters. Another 
                     limitation of using children’s proxy-reported information is the number of missing answers, which is lower when parents are 
                     asked to proxy-report their child’s education. In a simulation exercise, we establish that the bias introduced by proxy reports 
                     is not negligible, with self-reported intergenerational regression coefficients being 16% higher when a proxy-report is used.
